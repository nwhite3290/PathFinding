# PathFinding
Finds the shortest path between vertices in a graph.

**************************
Must use all files listed:
--------------------------
 * Graph.h
 * Node.h
 * LinkedList.h
 * Location.h
 * Stack2.h
 * PriorityQueue.h
 * Dijkstra.h and
 * main.cpp
*****************************
compile using makefile command:
------------------------------
$ make
 - creates binary file "path"

$ make clean
 - rm *.o and path

or, compile with:
-----------------
$ g++ main.cpp

====================
Other folder included
CityIO

City.cpp:
- reads "city.txt"
- reads "roads.txt"

Still need to:
 * city.cpp reads roads.txt and cities.txt
 * need to incorportate them into the PathFinding project
 * and change the program to either use the "int ID", or the "string City_Code"
 * also need to print out the distances from Dijkstra.h
 * finally need to add notes and clean it up.
